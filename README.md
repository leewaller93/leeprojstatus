# HAS Status Report App

A modern web application for tracking hospital accounting system (HAS) project status, team assignments, and feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with React Select for dropdowns)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (for persistence; previously SQLite for local dev)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (frontend), Node/Express backend (local or server)

---

## Features

- **Project Phases Table:** Track goals, comments, feedback, frequency, status, and assignments for each project phase.
- **Team Management:** Add, remove, and reassign team members.
- **Modern Filters:** Multi-select dropdowns for filtering by team member and status (using React Select).
- **Smart Pop-Out Editing:**  
  - Hover over a cell (Goal, Comments, Feedback) to see a wide, yellow, floating pop-out with the full content (scrollable if needed).
  - Click the pop-out to edit the text in a textarea.
  - Changes save on blur or Enter.
- **Partners Logo:** Displayed at the top right of the page.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/leewaller93/leeprojstatus.git
   cd leeprojstatus
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   - The app runs on http://localhost:3000 by default.

### Backend Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

> **Note:** The backend code is now included as a git submodule from [https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend](https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend). To make changes to the backend, edit and push to that repository, then update the submodule reference in this project and push again.

1. **Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster** (https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
2. **Get your connection string** and set it as an environment variable:
   - Locally: create a `.env` file in `has-status-backend/` with:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string
     ```
   - On Render: add `MONGODB_URI` in the Environment tab with your connection string.
3. **Start the backend:**
   ```sh
   cd has-status-backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   - The backend runs on http://localhost:5000.

## Deployment

> **Note:** The backend is managed as a submodule from [https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend](https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend). If you update the backend, be sure to update the submodule reference in this repo and push.

### ðŸš€ Quick Deploy (Recommended)

**Use the robust deployment script for reliable deployments:**

```powershell
# Quick deploy (dr1 = deploy-robust.ps1)
.\dr1.ps1

# Deploy with custom commit message
.\dr1.ps1 "Your custom message"
```

### ðŸ“‹ What the Deployment Script Does

The `deploy-robust.ps1` (dr1) script provides:

- âœ… **Pre-deployment health checks** - Tests both backend and frontend
- âœ… **Automatic git cleanup** - Stashes changes and pulls latest code
- âœ… **Backend deployment** - Commits changes, triggers Render, waits for health
- âœ… **Frontend deployment** - Builds React app, deploys to GitHub Pages
- âœ… **Post-deployment verification** - Confirms everything is working
- âœ… **Detailed logging** - Saves logs to `deploy-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`

### ðŸ”§ Manual Deployment (Legacy)

- **Frontend:** Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at  
  https://leewaller93.github.io/leeprojstatus/
- **To deploy manually:**  
  1. Commit and push changes to the `main` branch.
  2. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update.
  3. Refresh the site (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh).

### ðŸ“Š Deployment URLs

- **Frontend:** https://leewaller93.github.io/leeprojstatus/
- **Backend:** https://has-status-backend.onrender.com/
- **Health Check:** https://has-status-backend.onrender.com/api/phases?clientId=demo

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Fails with Syntax Error:**  
  - Remove any stray JSX comments like `{/* Filter UI with single selection */}` outside of JSX return blocks.
- **Pop-Out Not Working:**  
  - Ensure the `ExpandingCell` component uses a React portal for the pop-out, so it floats above the table and is not constrained by table layout.
- **Port Conflicts:**  
  - If something is running on port 3000, stop it or run the app on another port.

---

## Recent UI/UX Improvements

- Multi-select dropdown filters for team members and statuses.
- Modern, user-friendly filter UI (React Select).
- Smart pop-out for table cells (hover to view, click to edit, wide yellow box, scrollable).
- Partners logo moved to top right.
- Incremental improvements based on user feedback.

## Backend Auto-Deploy (Recommended for Shareable Test Environment)

To ensure your backend is always up-to-date and accessible for your GitHub Pages frontend, set up auto-deploy using GitHub Actions and SSH to your own server (VPS, cloud, or on-prem).

### Prerequisites
- A server (VPS, cloud, or on-prem) with Node.js and npm installed
- SSH access to the server
- Your backend repo cloned on the server
- (Optional) A process manager like pm2 for running the backend

### Setup Steps
1. **Generate an SSH key pair** on your local machine or in the GitHub Actions UI:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy"
   ```
   - Add the public key (`.pub`) to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
   - Add the private key as a GitHub Actions secret (e.g., `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`).
2. **Configure your server for passwordless SSH login from GitHub Actions.**
3. **Add the provided GitHub Actions workflow file to `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`.**
4. **Push to `main` branch:**
   - On every push, GitHub Actions will SSH into your server, pull the latest code, install dependencies, and restart the backend.

### Example SSH Deploy Workflow
See `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` in this repo for a template.

### Environment Variables
- Set your backend API URL in the frontend to your server's public address (e.g., `https://your-server.com/api`).
- Use `.env` files for secrets and configuration on your server.

### Keeping Everything in Sync
- Frontend auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push.
- Backend auto-deploys to your server on push.
- All users can access the live test environment at your public GitHub Pages URL.

## MongoDB Atlas Setup for Persistence

1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/ and create a free account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new project and then click "Create Deployment" (this is the new name for creating a cluster).
3. Choose the Free Tier (Shared, M0) and follow the prompts to create your cluster.
4. Once the cluster is ready, create a database user (username and password).
5. Click "Connect" and choose "Shell" or "Compass" to view your connection string. It will look like:
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
6. Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> as needed (e.g., hasstatus).
7. In your Render backend service, go to the Environment tab and add a new variable:
   - Key: MONGODB_URI
   - Value: (your full connection string)
8. Save and redeploy your backend.

After this, all data will be persistent and shareable across devices and browsers.

## Render Deployment Settings (Backend in Subdirectory)

- **Root Directory:** has-status-backend
- **Build Command:** npm install
- **Start Command:** node server.js

These settings ensure Render runs your Node/Express backend, not the frontend React dev server. Always double-check these after creating or updating your Render service.

## Submodule Restore & Recovery Guide (Critical Backend Fix)

If your backend submodule (`has-status-backend`) is not being cloned or deployed correctly (e.g., Render cannot find `server.js`), follow these steps to restore or fix it:

### 1. Ensure All Backend Data is Safe
- Go to your backend repo (e.g., https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend).
- Make sure all important files (including seed/demo data) are committed and pushed.
- If you have local changes in `has-status-backend`, commit and push them to the backend repo before proceeding.

### 2. Remove and Re-Add the Submodule
- In your main project root, run:
  ```sh
  git submodule deinit -f has-status-backend
  git rm -f has-status-backend
  git commit -m "Remove broken backend submodule"
  git push
  # Delete the local has-status-backend directory if it still exists
  rm -rf has-status-backend
  # Re-add the submodule
  git submodule add https://github.com/leewaller93/whiteboard-backend has-status-backend
  git commit -m "Re-add backend submodule, clean state"
  git push
  ```
- Confirm on GitHub that the `has-status-backend` folder in your main repo points to the correct backend repo and commit.

### 3. Redeploy on Render
- Trigger a manual deploy on Render.
- Check the build logs to ensure `server.js` is found and the backend starts successfully.

### 4. Why This Works
- This process guarantees the submodule pointer is correct, the backend repo is public, and all files are available to Render.
- As long as your backend repo is up to date, you will not lose any data.

**If you ever need to restore or fix the backend submodule, follow these steps for a safe recovery.**

### Automated Restore Script

You can use the provided `restore-has-status-backend.sh` script to automate the submodule restore process:

```sh
bash restore-has-status-backend.sh
```

This script will:
- Deinitialize and remove the existing submodule (if present)
- Commit and push the removal
- Re-add the backend submodule from the correct repo
- Commit and push the new submodule pointer

**After running the script, trigger a manual deploy on Render and check the build logs.**

---

### What to do next (very easy):

1. **Create a file called `.env` in your project root (where `src/` is).**
2. Add this line to the file (replace the URL with your actual Render backend URL if different):  
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://has-status-backend.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Restart your frontend development server** (if running) so it picks up the new environment variable.

---

### Final Checklist

- [x] Backend is in its own repo and not tracked by the main project.
- [x] Frontend code is ready to use the deployed backend.
- [ ] You just need to add the `.env` file as above.
- [ ] Deploy the backend to Render (instructions above).
- [ ] Set your MongoDB Atlas URI as `MONGODB_URI` in Render.

**Once youâ€™ve done these steps, your frontend will talk to your deployed backend, and everything will be clean and easy to maintain.**

If you want, I can also provide a quick summary of how to update the backend or frontend in the future, or help with any other step.
