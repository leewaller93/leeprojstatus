## Deployment

### ðŸš€ Quick Deploy (Recommended)

**Use the robust deployment script for reliable deployments:**

```powershell
# Quick deploy (dr1 = deploy-robust.ps1)
.\dr1.ps1

# Deploy with custom commit message
.\dr1.ps1 "Your custom message"
```

### ðŸ“‹ What the Deployment Script Does

The `deploy-robust.ps1` (dr1) script provides:

- âœ… **Pre-deployment health checks** - Tests both backend and frontend
- âœ… **Automatic git cleanup** - Stashes changes and pulls latest code
- âœ… **Backend deployment** - Commits changes, triggers Render, waits for health
- âœ… **Frontend deployment** - Builds React app, deploys to GitHub Pages
- âœ… **Post-deployment verification** - Confirms everything is working
- âœ… **Detailed logging** - Saves logs to `deploy-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`

### ðŸ“Š Deployment URLs

- **Frontend:** https://leewaller93.github.io/leeprojstatus/
- **Backend:** https://has-status-backend.onrender.com/
- **Health Check:** https://has-status-backend.onrender.com/api/phases?clientId=demo

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Fails with Syntax Error:**  
  - Remove any stray JSX comments like `{/* Filter UI with single selection */}` outside of JSX return blocks.
- **Pop-Out Not Working:**  
  - Ensure the `ExpandingCell` component uses a React portal for the pop-out, so it floats above the table and is not constrained by table layout.
- **Port Conflicts:**  
  - If something is running on port 3000, stop it or run the app on another port.

## Recent UI/UX Improvements

- Multi-select dropdown filters for team members and statuses.
- Modern, user-friendly filter UI (React Select).
- Smart pop-out for table cells (hover to view, click to edit, wide yellow box, scrollable).
- Partners logo moved to top right.
- Incremental improvements based on user feedback.
